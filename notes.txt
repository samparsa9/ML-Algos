1. Use least squares to fit a line to the data
2. Calculate R^2
3. Calculate a P value for R^2


1. Draw a random line through the data
2. Measure distance from the line to the data (calculate residuals),
square each distance and add them up
4. plot the rotation vs sum of squared residuals
on a separate graph
3. repeat
4. find the rotation that has the least sum of
squares (residuals)
5. Get the formula for the line


Calculating R^2
1. Find average value of y axis values (what were predicting)
2. Sum the squared residuals (distance from each y value from the average y value)
( also called SS(mean))
SS(mean) = (data-mean)^2
variation around the mean = (data-mean)^2 / n
3. Go back to original plot with best fit line
and calculate SS(fit), for the sum of squares
around the least squares fit
SS(fit) - (data - line)^2
var(fit) = SS(fit) / n
variance(something) = sum of squares / n = average sum of squares
R^2 tells us how much of the variation of a y label
can be explained by taking an x feature into account
R^2 = (var(mean) - var(fit)) / var(mean)
can also use (SS(mean) - SS(fit)) / SS(mean)
